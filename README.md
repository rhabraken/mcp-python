![Talk with Your Database Using MCP](image.png)

This guide explains how to set up and run your MCP server to interact with your
PostgreSQL database using Claude Desktop.

> **Note:** This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Docker,
> environment variables, and CLI usage.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Docker Compose**:
  [Installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- **Claude Desktop**: [Download here](https://claude.ai/download)
- **uv**: A lightweight process runner. If not installed, follow the
  instructions below.

---

## 1. Set Up Environment Variables

1. **Copy and Rename the Environment File**  
   Duplicate the provided `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

---

## 2. Set Up Claude Desktop

1. **Download and Install Claude Desktop**  
   Visit the [Claude Desktop download page](https://claude.ai/download) and
   install the application.

---

## 3. Launch the PostgreSQL Database with Dummy Data

1. **Run Docker Compose**  
   Ensure Docker Compose is installed and run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
   - This command will launch a PostgreSQL database on `localhost:5432` and
     populate it with dummy data.

---

## 4. Install `uv` (if not already installed)

1. **Install `uv`**  
   Execute the following command to install `uv`:
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

---

## 5. Configure and Launch the MCP Server

1. **Create/Update the MCP Server Configuration**  
   Save the following JSON configuration in your MCP server config file (adjust
   paths if necessary):

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "my_database": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/directory/where/this/app/is/located/app/",
           "run",
           "server.py"
         ],
         "env": {
           "DB_URL": "postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   - **Tip:** If `uv` is installed in a non-standard location, update the
     `"command"` value to reflect the full path to the executable.

2. **Launch the MCP Server**  
   With the configuration in place, the MCP server will automatically start each
   time Claude Desktop is launched.

---

## 6. Enjoy Your Setup

- Open **Claude Desktop**.
- The tool will automatically call your MCP server, enabling you to interact
  with your database seamlessly.

---

## Summary

1. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. **Install and Run Claude Desktop**: Download from
   [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download).
3. **Launch PostgreSQL with Docker Compose**: Run `docker-compose up` to start
   the database with dummy data.
4. **Install `uv`**: Run the provided installation command if necessary.
5. **Configure MCP Server**: Update the config file and ensure paths and
   environment variables are correct.
6. **Launch and Enjoy**: Start Claude Desktop to begin interacting with your
   database via MCP.
